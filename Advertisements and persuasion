Advertisements are one common form of persuasion. This exercise will give your group a chance to examine the forms of persuasion that are commonly used in advertisements.  Each group member is to watch TV or search the internet, and watch and analyze 3 commercials (i.e. 3 commercials per group member).  Specifically, you will need to use the Elaboration Likelihood Model to analyze each ad, to determine how the ad is trying to persuade you.  Make sure you pick a variety of commercials, presenting to different audiences and with different products.  
After each group member has watch and analyzed their commercials you should have a group discussion about persuasion, ways to persuade, and how advertisers try to persuade using advertisements.  Your group should write up your discussion and use this as the foundation of your essay, then as a group you should compare and contrast the different commercials you each collected, and how they seek to persuade you, using ELM, and related persuasion concepts.  In order to maximize points on this assignment you should make sure to fully explain and define ELM, persuasion, and concepts related to attitudes, in addition to using this information to analyze your ads.  You should look for the different characteristics listed on the questionnaire (use this for your own use, do not hand in questionnaires) below for each ad.
